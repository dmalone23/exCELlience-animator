Experience Review: In our opinion, there is no need to make any significant changes to our design if we had the chance to go back, as we feel that the design of each component was already clear and functional. We were not asked to change the code we provided to the customers. What was enlightening was learning how the flexibility of program design helps ensure a solid animator, as the way the providers handled state changes was much different to our own. As such, we feel both approaches were effective ways of creating a shape animator. Our providers were very supportive and quickly responded to any questions or concerns we raised. Initially their code did cause some confusion, though to their credit, any ambiguities were sufficiently cleared up. Overall we had a pretty good experience with our providers.
